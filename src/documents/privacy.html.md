## General

We collect the email addresses of those who communicate with us via email, aggregate information on what pages consumers access or visit, and information volunteered by the consumer (such as survey information and/or site registrations). The information we collect is used to improve the content and quality of our Service, and is not shared with or sold to other organizations for commercial purposes, except to provide products or services you've requested, when we have your permission, or under the following circumstances:

- It is necessary to share information in order to investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of [Terms of Service](http://bevry.me/tos), or as otherwise required by law.
- We transfer information about you if Bevry is acquired by or merged with another company. In this event, Bevry will notify you before information about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.


## Cookies

- A cookie is a small amount of data, which often includes an anonymous unique identifier, that is sent to your browser from a web site's computers and stored on your computer's hard drive.
- Cookies are required to use the Bevry service.
- We use cookies to record current session information, but do not use permanent cookies. You are required to re-login to your Bevry account after a certain period of time has elapsed to protect you against others accidentally accessing your account contents.


## Desktop

For some of our desktop software, in the case that the user has not identified themselves we will use a [hashed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) and [salted](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_\(cryptography\)) copy of the first [MAC address](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAC_address) of the machine the software is run on, this way we can uniquely (yet still anonymously) identify the user of the software for the purpose of understanding how many users are using the software.


## Data Storage

Bevry uses third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run Bevry. Although Bevry owns the code, databases, and all rights to the Bevry application, you retain all rights to your data.


## Disclosure

Bevry may disclose personally identifiable information under special circumstances, such as to comply with subpoenas or when your actions violate the [Terms of Service](http://bevry.me/tos).


## Changes

Bevry may periodically update this policy. We will notify you about significant changes in the way we treat personal information by sending a notice to the primary email address specified in your Bevry primary account holder account or by placing a prominent notice on our site.
